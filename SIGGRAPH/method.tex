\begin{align}
\energy = \mass \lightspeed^2
\label{eqn:emc2}
\end{align}

Always use defined instead of naked math symbols for clarify and consistency.
For example, in \Cref{eqn:emc2} I define all symbols inside \filename{symbols.tex} so later if I need to change $\energy$ from $E$ to $e$ I just need to change one line in \filename{symbols.tex} instead of chasing $E$ everywhere.
This can save you a lot of time and sanity if you have many math symbols.

\input{dart_throw_alg}

Pseudo-code can help summarize and explain the algorithms, but only if presented with sufficient clarity and simplicity. 
\Cref{alg:dart_throw} is an example.
All algorithms should be understandable from the main texts without looking at the pseudo-codes, which are usually more suitable for summarization than explanation.
