First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my PhD advisor Dr. Li-Yi Wei for his patient advice and continuous support for my research, internship and career. 
I appreciate all his time, ideas and encouragement to make my PhD experience productive and stimulating, and all the freedom he gave me that makes my research life fun and interesting. 
His pursuit of top works and perfect details was contagious and motivational for me, which is the priceless thing I learned from him.
